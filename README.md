# Boat Mapping Addon
The Boat Mapping Addon allows you to explore maps while sailing. With this addon, if you have a sail and a map in adjacent slots on your hotbar, holding either one counts as holding the other one as well. If you hold a map with a sail next to it, your boat will still move forward. If you hold a sail with a map next to it, the areas you sail through will be explored on your map.

# Installation
You can install the addon to your Better Than Wolves instance by adding the released .class files to your minecraft.jar, the same way you installed Better Than Wolves.

# Using the source code
The source code for the addon is available as a git patch. You can apply it to the decompiled source code of Better Than Wolves using `git apply --directory=src src.patch`. You can find more information about obtaining the decompiled source code [here](https://www.sargunster.com/btw/index.php?title=Creating_Addons).

The patch modifies `EntityPlayer.java` and `ItemMap.java`.
