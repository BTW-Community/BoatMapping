# Boat Mapping Addon
The Boat Mapping Addon allows you to explore maps while sailing. With this addon, if you have a sail and a map in adjacent slots on your hotbar, holding either one counts as holding the other one as well. If you hold a map with a sail next to it, your boat will still move forward. If you hold a sail with a map next to it, the areas you sail through will be explored on your map.

# Installation
You can install the addon by placing the release jar in the mods folder of a BTW CE 2.0 client or server.
